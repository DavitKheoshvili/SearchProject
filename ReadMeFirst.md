First of all to use this web application, you need to clone repository localy. Follow steps:

1.1 Press green "code" button and copy the link in https tab. 

1.2 Open cmd or terminal. Go to the folder(it should be git repository. If it is not, enter command: "git init" ) where you want to clone this repository.
Then enter the command: "git clone https://github.com/DavitKheoshvili/SearchProject.git "
This is the link you just copied.

You already have clone of project. Now you need to install project dependences. 

2.1 Enter command in cmd or terminal: "npm install" 
Start local server

3.1 Enter command: "npm start"

Default port the application using is 3000. It can be used by another program, in that case comand propt ask you if want to use another port for this aplication. 
Just press yes. 

Once it is finished you can open your favourite code editor (I am using visual studio code) and see source of project. Also you can go throw web browser http://localhost:3000/
and search valid user of GitHub(notice port is still 3000 or changed).
